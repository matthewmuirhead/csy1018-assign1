            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              Joel regularly enjoys breaking things from computers to code and even cats (how do you 'break' a cat? Pro tip: never let them play with sticky tape!).
              Thankfully he also loves figuring out how put them back together and get them working again. He naturally blames it on all that Lego as a child, but it seemingly made him a great programmer too.
              A problem solver and inquisitive by nature he may be, but he also spontaneously combusts into laughter at the most random of things - it really isn't unusual to find Joel giggling away, curiously infectious to many others around him.
              He can usually found buried deep in code wailing out the hits of the 80s thinking nobody else can hear him, or touring around the world for the latest fix of adrenaline on a terrifying new rollercoaster.
              Sometimes though he loves nothing better than simply soaking up a beautiful sunset at a picturesque natural location with his significant otherâ€¦ a laptop of course!
              Code, coasters, cats, cookies and Pepsi (not coffee!)... that sums him up.
